    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having spent nearly 10 years doing my best to avoid wrestling with the client-side web, the necessity to better prepare myself for a new future (think tech startup) means I&rsquo;ve begun some serious dabbling on &ldquo;the wild side&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At first it was just a case of some casual flirting, but that has now extended as far as a proper first date.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long been coming round to the idea that, in order to build a rich application experience in the browser, Java does not have the answer &ndash; for me, the Java component based framework experiments have failed (ThoughtWorks agreed with me in <a href="http://thoughtworks.fileburst.com/assets/technology-radar-october-2012.pdf">October 2012</a>). I feel sad to say this because, whilst I despised JSF right from the start, I kinda liked Wicket and Tapestry. Without wanting to get too heretical, the Java Swing programming model is grounded in some pretty solid coding patterns and, as close as Wicket comes to realising a similar approach on the web, you just can&rsquo;t get away from the fact that the web just ain&rsquo;t really built for that stuff.</p>

<p>So, that date I was referring to was with a cute little beast called <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>. After initially being slightly sick in my mouth at the thought of a journey beyond statically typed languages, I&rsquo;ve begun to come round to the idea that JavaScript needn&rsquo;t be so bad as long as you play by the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">rules</a>, and you couple your exploration with a neat framework like AngularJS. With AngularJS, I&rsquo;m once again playing with a component-ish framework that is not trying to exist on top of an unsuitable protocol &ndash; the rich interactions live in the browser where they feel most at home.</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about AngularJS is that I can even apply some of my most loyal of server-side patterns (I&rsquo;m thinking dependency injection) when hacking client code. And, even more importantly, I still get my server-side fix through building predictable, testable, stateless APIs for the stateful client to consume.</p>

<p>I definitely see this going to a second date, and beyond.</p>

<p>On a final note, I do feel that <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> deserves a special mention here as well. There&rsquo;s no doubt that I suck at CSS, and I truly mean that. But, with Bootstrap, no longer must server-side developers walk naked and exposed in the presentational side of the web. I don&rsquo;t care for CSS &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I ever will &ndash; but with Bootstrap I&rsquo;ve now got half a chance of making web apps that don&rsquo;t only work good, but look good at the same time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks the beginning of a new chapter in my software engineering life. I’ve been an enterprise Java dev for so many years that it’s boring to even talk about it. Don’ t get me wrong, I love my job (if you can even call it a job) but sometimes one needs a spark, a chance to re-experience a honeymoon period that extends beyond love and into a kind of uncontrollable, rapturous madness.</p>

<p>The murmurings for this new chapter began a few weeks ago when I enrolled on Martin Odersky’s “Functional Programming Principles in Scala” course – a fantastic FREE online course that runs for seven weeks, supported by <a href="http://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> in Switzerland. For sure, I’ve been well aware of the rise of Scala within the industry but had never gotten round to really indulging in this exciting language (except, maybe, for getting through a few chapters of <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed/">Programming in Scala</a> on my Kindle). The same goes for the <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play! Framework</a>, something I’ve kept an eye on at arm’s length for quite a few years now.</p>

<p>I’m now into the fourth week of Odersky’s course and, following completion of the first three challenging, but almost perversely absorbing, assignments, today I decided it was time to fire up my first Play2 application. Fortunately, I picked up a little freelance client project last week and it was a bit of a no brainer, given my newly mobilised appetite for all things Scala, to implement it using a technology (Play!) I really knew was overdue an evaluation.</p>

<p>Just a few hours after downloading Play! 2.0.4, I have fallen hopelessly under it’s spell – I’ve been wandering around the house in what resembles a drunken stupor, close to screaming with excitement at what I’ve learned and been able to achieve in just one afternoon. My face aches, my jaw having been locked into a permanent smile. I know this is the future, though I feel a certain degree of sadness as I acknowledge my love affair with JEE, and it’s wonderful layer upon layer of abstraction, to be very nearly over (we need to stay friends, mind – my day job will see to that).</p>

<p>The anticipation. The butterflies. So the journey begins.</p>
