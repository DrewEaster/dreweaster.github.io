    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I’ve been involved in some really interesting discussions on the Akka User mailing list of late and thought it would be good to translate something I wrote, in one particular thread, into a blog post.</p>

<p>I recently became rather obsessed with Domain Driven Design (DDD), CQRS and Event Sourcing. Given an existing passion for Akka (actor based programming), it dawned on me that the actor model might be an extremely good fit for the aforementioned “Holy Trio” of paradigms/patterns. Whilst trying to build a prototype, I brought up the topic on the Akka User mailing list and became aware that the Akka Team were actively working on Akka Persistence, which is well ahead of my dirty little prototype! For one reason or another, within a post on the mailing list, I ended up brain dumping my understanding of how Akka Persistence and the “Holy Trio” fits together, so here follows a blog friendly version!</p>

<h2>Akka and the Holy Trio</h2>

<p>So, it seems like the actor model fits very well with DDD, and I&rsquo;m not the first person to think this &ndash; <a href="https://vaughnvernon.co/">Vaughn Vernon</a> is well ahead of the game!</p>

<p>It feels quite natural to me to consider an actor analogous to an aggregate root (in DDD speak). Rather than just seeing an actor as a mediator sitting in front of a database, you see the actor conceptually as an entity. By incorporating event sourcing, the actor works on the basis of processing a command (representing some action) and outputting one or many events that represent the result of processing that command. At all times the actor encapsulates its current state, which can simply be seen as the result of a series of ordered events applied to it.</p>

<p>Initially, it’s actually quite helpful to ignore persistence requirements altogether and just rely on the state within the actor – in this way you don’t allow persistence concerns to influence the way you design your domain – I often find that domain models end up messy because, despite attempts to avoid doing so, persistence concerns end up, in one form or another, leaking into the business logic. Any approach to building a domain layer, that can genuinely remove the need to consider persistence technologies, is an attractive proposition in my mind!</p>

<p>By following an event sourcing approach, persistence becomes no more complex than just persisting the events – that the actor produces – in an event store (journal). Given that events represent an immutable history of state changes, the journal can be append only, and that’s pretty exciting from a performance perspective. This is something that can quite clearly be bolted on once you’ve already put together a working in-memory only version of your domain – the actors themselves can be completely agnostic to the existence of the persistence mechanism. This is where Akka Persistence comes in – it works on the following basis:</p>

<ol>
<li>Actor receives command</li>
<li>Actor processes command (applies business logic) and produces events that represent results of processing</li>
<li>Events are persisted to journal</li>
<li>Events are applied to actor so it can update it&rsquo;s internal state</li>
</ol>


<p>Akka Persistence pretty much deals with everything other than the command handling step, which represents your custom business logic – Akka is not quite good enough (yet) to do that bit ;–)</p>

<p>Step 4 is quite important – it’s key that internal state is only applied once you’re sure events have been persisted to the journal. Also, by separating this step, it serves the additional purpose of allowing events in the journal to be replayed onto a “green” instance of the actor such to bring its internal state back up to current. Akka Persistence also has support for “snapshots” which allow you to take periodic snapshots of current state to be used as a performance optimisation when replaying events.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, the actor model just fits with the “Holy Trio”. It seems to deal with a majority of the pain points experienced when building a domain layer using more traditional CRUD techniques. It’s pretty exciting to me how natural this design feels without any need to consider using an ORM ;–)</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>And that’s the end of the blog friendly version of my brain dump! I truly believe the combination of the actor model with DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing is going to become a very prevalent domain model design solution in the future.</p>

<p>I have to add that the Akka Team (including Patrik, Martin, Roland etc.) continue to be such an inspiration. Keep up the good work, guys!</p>

    <id>http://DrewEaster.github.io/blog/2013/07/08/reactive-real-time-log-search-with-play-akka-angularjs-and-elasticsearch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve decided to contribute an Activator Template to TypeSafe (will submit soon, promise!). Having recently become more and more involved in Elasticsearch, I saw a great opportunity to put together a neat &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; application combining Play &amp; Akka with the &ldquo;bonsai cool" <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/percolate/">percolation</a> feature of Elasticsearch. Then, to put a cherry on top, use AngularJS on the client-side to create a dynamically updating UI.</p>

<p>What I came up with is slightly contrived &ndash; a very basic real-time log entry search tool &ndash; but I think it provides a really nice base for apps that want to integrate this bunch of technologies.</p>

<p><a href="/images/real-time-search.png"><img class="center" src="/images/real-time-search.png" width="600" height="264"></a></p>

<p>All the code for the application is available on Github <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search">here</a>. In this post, I&rsquo;ve attempted to dissect the Activator Template tutorial I&rsquo;ve written and regurgitate it in blog form.</p>

<h3>Play and Akka</h3>

<p>Play and Akka are used to implement the reactive server-side application. The application favours SSE (Server Sent Events) to push updates to the client. The template introduces a number of interesting topics, including Play Iteratees/Enumerators and Akka Actors.</p>

<h3>AngularJS</h3>

<p>AngularJS has been chosen on the client-side to demonstrate how simple it can be to build a dynamic, single page user experience with very little code.</p>

<h3>Elasticsearch</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;bonsai cool&rdquo; percolation feature of Elasticsearch achieves the real-time search aspect of the application. The application starts up an embedded Elasticsearch node, so no need to run your own external instance. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/utils/EmbeddedESServer.scala">EmbeddedESServer</a> for the embedded server code. There is a custom <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/Global.scala">Global</a> where the embedded server is started and shutdown as part of the application lifecycle.</p>

<h2>The Actors</h2>

<p>The application has three actors:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/actors/MainSearchActor.scala">MainSearchActor</a> supervises and coordinates data flows</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/actors/ElasticSearchActor.scala">ElasticsearchActor</a> interacts with Elasticsearch percolation API</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/actors/LogEntryProducerActor.scala">LogEntryProducerActor</a> generates &lsquo;random&rsquo; log entry data</li>
</ul>


<h3>MainSearchActor</h3>

<p>This actor&rsquo;s job is to coordinate the reactive parts of the application and supervise the other actors. It is the main dependency of the application&rsquo;s single Play <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/controllers/Application.scala">controller</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Starting/stopping a search</strong></p>

<p>The actor responds to a <code>StartSearch</code> message by &lsquo;replying&rsquo; with an <code>Enumerator</code> to the sender. The <code>Enumerator</code> wraps a unicast channel to which log entries are pushed that match the query string sent within the message. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some code:</p>

<p>The Play Iteratees library has the very handy <code>Concurrent</code> utilities. In this case, <code>Concurrent.unicast</code> is called to create an <code>Enumerator</code> that encloses a <code>Concurrent.Channel</code>. When the channel starts (<code>onStart</code>), it is stored in a map local to the actor (using UUID as key) and the <code>StartSearch</code> message is forwarded onto the <code>ElasticSearchActor</code> where the query will be percolated in Elasticsearch. It&rsquo;s worth noting that this code is not production ready &ndash; it ought to be a transactional operation, i.e. we should only store the channel once we know Elasticsearch has successfully percolated the query. You will notice that a <code>StopSearch</code> message is sent to <code>self</code> such that the channel is removed from the local map, and the percolated query is deleted, when the channel is no longer useful (i.e. is closed by the client, or an error occurs).</p>

<p><strong>Broadcasting matching results</strong></p>

<p>The actor will receive a <code>SearchMatch</code> message when a log entry has matched a percolated query.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>On receipt of the message, each matching id is iterated over and the corresponding channel is retrieved from the local map. The log entry is then pushed to the channel, and thus onto the client.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling log entry creation</strong></p>

<p>The actor uses the Akka scheduler to send a <code>Tick</code> to the <code>LogEntryProducerActor</code> every second &ndash; in the real world, this would obviously be unnecessary, as genuine log entries would be fed into the application in some other way. The <code>Tick</code> is sent to <code>self</code> before being forwarded on to the <code>LogEntryProducerActor</code>.</p>

<h3>ElasticsearchActor</h3>

<p>This actor has responsibility for both registering queries in Elasticsearch and percolating log entry documents against those queries. Rather than utilise the Elasticsearch Java Client, the code, instead, crafts the Elasticsearch API calls manually, demonstrating the use of the asynchronous Play WS API to execute them. For simplicity, the calls are hard coded to talk to Elasticsearch on localhost:9200 (where the embedded server will be listening).</p>

<p>The code is fairly self explanatory within this actor. Do note that there is a lack of error handling on the API calls thus making this actor unsuitable for production use in its current form. It is recommended you read the Elasticsearch <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/percolate/">documentation on percolation</a> to learn more about this powerful feature.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one little important gotcha this code has avoided &ndash; closing over the <code>sender</code> ref in an asynchronous callback block. The <code>sender</code> ref is part of the shared mutable state of the actor and so, if the actor were to reply to the sender in the percolate callback, a race condition would be encountered if another thread had modified the actor&rsquo;s state before the percolation call to Elasticsearch had completed. This race condition has been avoided by ensuring to &lsquo;freeze&rsquo; the <code>sender</code> ref, by sending it to a private function:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scala'><span class='line'><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">percolate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">logJson</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">JsValue</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">requestor</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">ActorRef</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>and close over the parameter instead.</p>

<h3>LogEntryProducerActor</h3>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the detail of this actor. Suffice to say, its job is to generate a random, JSON formatted log event whenever it receives a <code>Tick</code> message. In reality, a genuine source of log events would replace this actor.</p>

<h2>The Play Controller</h2>

<p>As most of the server-side logic exists within the actors, the single Play controller is very simple. The most interesting aspect of the controller is the action that opens an event stream connected with the client:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>The most important thing to note is the use of the Akka &lsquo;ask&rsquo; pattern of message exchange (notice the use of &lsquo;?&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;!&rsquo;). This differs from the more typical fire-and-forget approach in that we&rsquo;re able to asynchronously pick up a reply from the recipient actor. In this scenario, a <code>StartSearch</code> message is sent to the <code>MainSearchActor</code> which replies with an <code>Enumerator</code> used to stream search results to the client. Given the use of the &lsquo;ask&rsquo; pattern, we wrap the action logic in an <code>Async</code> block &ndash; so not to hold up other requests &ndash; rather than blocking until the <code>Future</code> yields a result.</p>

<h2>The User Interface</h2>

<p>The key parts of the application UI are:</p>

<ol>
<li>A Play <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/views/index.scala.html">template</a> with AngularJS specific markup</li>
<li>A single AngularJS <a href="https://github.com/drewzilla/realtime-search/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/controllers.js">controller</a></li>
</ol>


<p>The application makes use of the <a href="http://www.webjars.org/">WebJars</a> project to simplify the introduction of its JS and CSS dependencies (e.g. AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap).</p>

<h3>UI Template</h3>

<p>Firstly, the opening <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is linked to the controller <code>SearchCtrl</code> that subsequently enables the automagical databinding power of AngularJS. A simple search form captures an Apache Lucene formatted query string. A search can be started by clicking on the &lsquo;Search&rsquo; button which invokes the <code>startSearching()</code> function defined in the controller. Finally, you can see the use of AngularJS two-way databinding to render matching search results contained within the view model (only displays the latest 10 matches):</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scala'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">tr</span> <span class="n">ng</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">repeat</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;searchResult in searchResults | limitTo:10&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h3>The AngularJS Controller</h3>

<p>The AngularJS controller is fairly straightforward. The key part is handling a new search:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Firstly, an existing search is stopped (if running) and the results model cleared (will automagically clear any existing results from the HTML markup). Secondly, an event stream connection is made to the server and an event listener is added that pushes matching search results into the model as they arrive from the server.</p>

<p>As we are updating the model (in the <code>addSearchResult</code> function) outside of it&rsquo;s knowledge, we&rsquo;ve had to explicitly tell Angular that we&rsquo;ve pushed a new result to the model by wrapping the code in a function passed to <code>$scope.apply</code>. See the Angular docs for the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope">$scope</a> object for more information.</p>

<h2>Using the application</h2>

<p>Fire up the application using <code>play run</code> and point your browser (not IE &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t support SSE. Doh!) to <a href="http://localhost:9000">http://localhost:9000</a>. Using the application is as simple as entering an Apache Lucene formatted query. Please read the Lucene <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_3_1/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package_description">query parser syntax documentation</a> for more information on how to construct Lucene query strings. A simple example would be to enter &ldquo;GET&rdquo; as your query string, thus matching all log entries for GET requests.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
